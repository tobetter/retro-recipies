Description: Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator (MAME)
 MAME is a hardware emulator: it faithfully reproduces the behavior of many
 arcade machines (it is not a simulation). This program is not a game but can
 directly, through ROM images, run the complete system of these old arcade
 machines. These ROMs are subject to copyright and it is in most of the cases
 illegal to use them if you do not own the arcade machine.
 .
 This package provides the MAME binary and configuration files.

  The configuration format for RESAMPLE was changed from a simple numeric
  representation to a string representation. It works similar to the
  resample-method setting of pulseaudio, but will not automatically get
  converted. Following values are possible:

  * trivial (was setting "1")
  * src-linear
  * src-zero-order-hold
  * src-sinc-fastest
  * src-sinc-medium-quality
  * src-sinc-best-quality (was setting "2")
  * speex-fixed-0
  * speex-fixed-1
  * speex-fixed-2
  * speex-fixed-3
  * speex-fixed-4
  * speex-fixed-5
  * speex-fixed-6
  * speex-fixed-7
  * speex-fixed-8
  * speex-fixed-9
  * speex-fixed-10

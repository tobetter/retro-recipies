Description: Glide64Mk2 high-level graphics emulation for mupen64plus
 High-level graphics emulation plugin for known microcodes based on Glide. This

 Voodoo cards. It supports advanced graphics effects of the N64 and loading of
 high resolution texture packs.
 .
 It is based on Glide64 Napalm which was ported to Linux and amd64.
